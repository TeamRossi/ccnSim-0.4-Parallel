Thank you for joining the ccnSim community!  

This is ccnSim-Parallel, the new ccnSim version which implements the parallel 
version of the ModelGraft technique [1, 2].

For information about installation and sample scenarios, please follow the 
detailed instructions provided in the ccnSim-Parallel User Manual, 
available at http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~drossi/ccnSim

Please also read the documentation inside the provided "runsim_script_Parallel_ModelGraft.sh"
script in order to have a clear understanding of the simulation process.

Please note that simulations with ccnSim-Parallel require 
a patched version of the Akaroa2Â© software [3, 4]. While the patch is freely distributed at
[1], users should obtain a valid license in order to download Akaroa-2.7.13, i.e., 
the original version used for the development of ccnSim-Parallel. 
For info related to the various types of license please visit the 
Akaroa Project Website at [3].
