What's new in ccnSim-Parallel

** SUMMARY

ccnSim-Parallel introduces the possibility to parallelize simulations w.r.t. the former ccnSim-v0.4,
by relying on an innovative approach for the parallelization of general cache network simulations.

In particular, it integrates two different softwares: (i) the open source ccnSim-v0.4 simulator [1], which 
includes the implementation of the single-threaded ModelGraft technique [2], and (ii) the licensed 
Akaroa2© software [3, 4], which provides APIs for the design of a master-slave infrastructure. 

Modifications have been made to both, in order to ease their integration and adapt the code of ccnSim 
to the parallel ModelGraft technique, thus conceiving this unique and dedicated version. 
Due to the strong integration between the two aforementioned softwares, ccnSim-Parallel requires 
the modified Akaroa2©. 
It is important to notice that users should obtain a specific license for the download of the original Akaroa-2.7.13,
i.e., the initial version used for the deployment of ccnSim-Parallel.
A dedicated patch needed to integrate the required modifications, instead, is freely distributed at [1].
